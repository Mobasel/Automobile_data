# Automobile_data
I found a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaya23abdul/automobile-database) on Kaggle that contains Automobile Sales, so, I decided to dig deeper and analyze it to get insights related to the sales and price distribution, Performance, Customer Preference, and Trend & Comparative Analysis.

Here is the Work Sheet: [Automobile_data.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18664186/Automobile_data.xlsx)

These questions cover descriptive analytics, comparative analysis, and even some trend insights that could help in understanding the data better"

##### ðŸš— Sales & Price Insights
- What is the average price of cars by manufacturer (e.g., Alfa-Romeo, Audi)? 
- Which car model has the highest price and which has the lowest? 
- What is the price distribution for cars with different body styles (e.g., sedan vs. convertible)? 
- What is the average price difference between gas and turbo aspiration cars? 
- How does the number of cylinders affect the average car price? 
- What is the correlation between horsepower and price? (Higher horsepower, higher price?) 


##### âš¡ Performance Analysis
- Which fuel type (gas vs diesel) provides the best city and highway mileage?
